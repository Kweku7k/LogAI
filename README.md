# LogAI

> AI-powered Python logging handler with RAG-based error analysis and Telegram alerts.

LogAI is an **open-source Python package** that turns your application logs into a real-time debugging companion.  
When an error occurs, LogAI uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to pull relevant log context and feed it to an AI model, producing human-friendly explanations of what failed and why.  
It then starts a conversation in **Telegram** so engineers can ask follow-up questions, dig deeper into past logs, and troubleshoot collaboratively — without digging through endless log files.
